# Medical Expenses Project

This project is designed to help medical professionals and patients manage and analyze medical expenses using Python. The project includes a set of scripts and modules for managing medical expense data, as well as a set of examples and tutorials to help users get started with analyzing and visualizing their own medical expenses.


## Installation

To use the Medical Expenses Project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once you have installed Python, you can download the project files from our repository:

https://github.com/Bhaktidas/Medical-Expenses-Project

you can then install the required Python libraries by running the following command in the project directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all of the necessary dependencies, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.






    
## Usage/Examples

To use the medical expenses scripts, you can run the following command in the project directory:

python manage_expenses.py

This will run the main expense management script, which will prompt you to enter the filename of the expense data file you want to manage. You can then choose from a variety of expense management options, including adding and removing expenses, categorizing expenses, and generating expense reports.

You can also use the Jupyter notebooks provided in the "notebooks" directory to explore and analyze your medical expenses interactively. These notebooks include examples of common expense analysis tasks and techniques, as well as sample medical expense datasets to practice on.
